# passcal
Implementation of pascal interpreter in python. Based on the https://ruslanspivak.com series.
This is a work in progress, you probably shouldn't even use this when it is done, though. ;)
Feel free to read provided you pay Ruslan's blog a visit. This is heavily based around his interpreter.
